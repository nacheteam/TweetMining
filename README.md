# TweetMining
Mining data from twitter as an example os twitter4j usage.
# Usage and installing
You should download from http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html the twitter4j lib and add it to the NetBeans project manually. You should as well put your TwitterApps credentials in the TwitterMiningFunctions file.
The javadoc is available for all methods in MiningFunctions.
#How to help?
I'm actually making a function to be able to plot a friends graph. This function should make a .dat file (wherever in the desktop) that could be plotted with gnuplot. This graph should obtain the positions of the points based at least in the friends that you share with each of your friends. The function is in the TwitterMiningFunctions.java file.
